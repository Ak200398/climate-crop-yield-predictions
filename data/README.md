# Dataset Description: Climate and Crop Yield Data

## Overview

This dataset is a comprehensive collection of climate and agricultural data aimed at supporting research in crop yield prediction. It contains information on climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall, and pesticide usage, alongside crop yield data from various regions over several decades. The dataset is intended for machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization applications to enhance agricultural decision-making.
